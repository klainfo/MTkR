Writing an IEEE CS Conference paper with R Markdown
===================================================

_Context_: paper based on empirical studies are becoming more and more common in
  Software Engineering (SE) research. In such studies a relevant part of the work
  consists in data analysis. Sharing the data and the analysis method (or even code)
  is considered a good practice, the goal is to make research as reproducible
  as possible.  
  A widely used tool for performing statistical analysis is **R**, often associated with the **RStudio**
  development environment. Such environment provide provides R Markdown as a blend of scripting and
  documentation with powerful mechanisms.

  _Goal_: the objective of this work analyze the main issues in writing a paper in markdown and
  generating a document compliant with the guidelines for IEEE CS conferences.

  _Method_: a case study was conducted by writing a paper for an ICSE workshop, during the task
  several issues were encountered and possible solutions are put forward and validated.

  _Results_: a kit comprising a template and guidelines has been put together which allows producing
  a paper formatted properly. 

  _Conclusions_: starting from an R Markdown document we can generate a compliant paper that
  allows reproducible data analys one cornerstone of an open scientific method. Actually this very paper
  has been written using the presented approach.
